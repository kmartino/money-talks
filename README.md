money-talks
===========

Money Talks focuses on local campaign finance data from Philadelphia.
It was initiated by journalists Tom Ferrick and Chris Brennan,
partnered with Karl Martino, Inquirer data visualization specialist
Rob Kandell and Kristen Mosbrucker, and Jared Brey, during 2012's
Barcamp NewsInnovation hackathon event.

The script, as it is currently in Github, downloads header-less CSVs
from ftp://ftp.phila-records.com/, re-structures them, and then
uploads that content to Google Fusion for visualization and searching.
The script is reusable against other header-less CSV's sources over
FTP, and could be quickly repurposed to parse data from other
Web-based locations. The script is written in such a way that it can
be ran repeatidly without unwanted side-effects.

Coming soon:

1. The front end Web-based interface to the data at Google Fusion.

2. Fleshing out a strong set unit tests that can mock the remote
sources of data.

3. Improved script interface and error handling.

4. A write-up explaining the mechanics of the script, why it is
organized the way it is, to help others who would like to write
similar automated routines.

Installation and Setup
----------------------

### Install System Pre-requisites

Money Talks requires Python 2.6 or higher. In addition, the
following pre-requisites need to be installed. If you already have
them, skip this:

Install virtualenv:

    sudo easy_install virtualenv 

Install pip:

    sudo easy_install pip

### Install Project Pre-requisites

When running the project for the first time, execute the following
steps. 

Navigate to the directory you extracted or checked out the
project to.

Create your virtualenv environment:

    virtualenv --no-site-packages .env 

Activate the project's virtualenv:

    source .env/bin/activate

Install the project's python libraries:

    pip install -r pip-requires.txt

Now you can run the project!!!!

Running the script
------------------

### Runing unit tests

Navigate to the directory you extractred, or checked out the project
to.

Activate the project's virtualenv if you haven't already:

    source .env/bin/activate

Run the unit test script:

    python -m unittest moneytalks_test

### Running the script

Navigate to the directory you extracted, or checked out the project
to.

Activate the project's virtualenv if you haven't already:

    source .env/bin/activate

To download csv files from the source system (overwrites files
locally):

    python moneytalks.py e DEBUG
   
To extract information from them and create the local db file
(overwrites the db file locally):

    python moneytalks.py t DEBUG

To load the db file to your Google Fusion tables (this will prompt for
the credentials you associate with your Google Fusion account):

    python moneytalks l DEBUG

The above will create the target tables indicated in
moneytalks_config.py, with the columns indicated. If those tables
exist, and rows with matching IDs exist, the script will update those
rows. So running this repeatitively will not result in ever more rows
being appended to your target tables.
